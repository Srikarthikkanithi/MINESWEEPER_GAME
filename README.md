# MINESWEEPER_GAME
We play on a square board and we have to click on the board on the cells which do not have a mine. And obviously, we donâ€™t know where mines are. If a cell where a mine is present is clicked then we lose, else we are still in the game. 
There are three levels for this game- 

Beginner - 9 * 9 Board and 10 Mines
Intermediate - 16 * 16 Board and 40 Mines
Advanced - 24 * 24 Board and 99 Mines

When you click on a cell if it is not a mine then it will display the number of mines there are around the cell and continue the game
